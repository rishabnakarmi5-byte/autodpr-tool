    The output format must be a list of items with the following fields:
    - location: The major site location (e.g., "Powerhouse", "Headworks", "HRT - Inlet"). Infer this from context if possible.
    - chainageOrArea: The specific sub-area or chainage mentioned (e.g., "Tailrace Invert", "Apron", "Ch 100-200").
    - activityDescription: What work was done today (include quantities like m3, T, msq).
    - plannedNextActivity: What is planned for tomorrow/next day.

    Here is the raw text:
    """
    ${rawText}

    If the text contains multiple distinct activities (e.g., different bullet points for different areas), break them into separate items.
    Clean up the text to be professional and concise suitable for a formal report.
